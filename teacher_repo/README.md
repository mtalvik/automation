## ðŸŽ¯ Teaching Philosophy

### Educational Progression:
1. **Week 13:** Educational creation (students write automation code)
2. **Week 15 LAB:** Educational creation (students create roles from scratch)
2. **Week 15 HOMEWORK:** Operational deployment (students deploy and compare)
3. **Week 19:** Operational deployment (students deploy and test)

### Hybrid Approach:
- **âœ… Students create:** Automation files (playbooks, configs, scripts)
- **âœ… Students get:** Web assets, complex infrastructure, complete applications
- **âœ… Students learn:** Practical skills, not web development

## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

### For Each Repository:

1. **Push to GitHub** as public repositories
2. **Share repository URLs** with students in homework instructions
3. **Students clone** appropriate starter repository
4. **Students work** on automation aspects
5. **Students submit** their completed repositories
